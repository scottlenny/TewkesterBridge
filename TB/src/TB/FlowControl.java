/**
  Controls the flow of traffic over the bridge
  
  This version uses the following strategy for satisfying the 3 requirements<p>
  
  Req 1: "It must operate safely"<p>
  When traffic is stopped flowing in one direction,
  it waits TIME_CLEAR seconds to allow traffic to clear off the bridge,
  before traffic is allowed to flow in the opposite direction.<p>
  
  Req 2: "It must make efficient use of the bridge"<p>
  Traffic is not allowed to flow into town,
  unless a vehicle is sensed wanting to travel into town.<p>
  
  Req 3: "It must give precedence to traffic leaving town"<p>
  (a) Traffic is allowed to flow out of town for at least MIN_EW seconds<p>
  (b) Traffic wanting to travel out of town,
  should not have to wait for more than MAX_WAIT seconds
